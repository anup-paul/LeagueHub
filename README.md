# League Hub
## LiveSite Url: https://leaguehub-f1edd.web.app/
On this web site, user can see all the details of which league he or she selected.

If the selected league is a male-league, then the details page shows a male photo and if the selected league is a female, then the details page shows a female photo. In the footer, I also used some fontawsome icons.
